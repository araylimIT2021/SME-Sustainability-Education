#Viridi Academy for SMEs - A Week-Long Project
I'm excited to introduce the project our international team has been diligently working on over the past week: the VIRIDI Academy. Our goal is to empower Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with knowledge on sustainability practices and guide them in their implementation.
